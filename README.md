`output_checker` is a tool that allows **analysts** to check if their **code is ok to
export**

It does this by running a few simple checks. The envisaged workflow is:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Statistical Disclosure Control] --> B{Values below a threshold?};
    A --> C{Values not rounded?};
    B -->|Pass| D[Ok to output];
    B -->|Fail| E[Identifies problems];
    C -->|Pass| D[Ok to output];
    C -->|Fail| E[Identifies problems];
```

## Getting started
