## Top-level files

Each subsection here contains a brief description about the files at the top-level of
this Git repository.

### `.env`

Environment variables go here, and can be read in by Python using the `python-dotenv` package, and `os.getenv`:

```in script
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

#Load the environment variables from the `.env` file, overriding any system
#environment variables
load_dotenv(override=True)

# Example variable
EXAMPLE_VARIABLE = os.getenv("EXAMPLE_VARIABLE")
```

### `.envrc`

Orchestration file to load environment variables from the `.env` and `.secrets` files.
Only used by systems with `direnv` (https://direnv.net/) installed. Environment
variables can be read in by Python using `os.getenv` _without_ using `python-dotenv`:

```in script
import os

# Example variable
EXAMPLE_VARIABLE = os.getenv("EXAMPLE_VARIABLE")
```


### `.flake8`

A configuration file for the `flake8` Python package that provides linting. This file
is based on the [common configuration described in the GDS Way][gds-way-flake8].

### `.gitignore`

A `.gitignore` file to ignore certain files and folders from this Git repository. [See
the contributor guide to modift the `.gitignore` file][docs-updating-gitignore].

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

[A pre-commit hook configuration file][docs-pre-commit-hooks].

### `.secrets`

A file to store all secrets and credentials as environment variables. [This file is
read-in by `.envrc`](#envrc), when [loading environment variables with the `direnv`
shell extension][direnv], but is not tracked by Git.

### `.secrets.baseline`

[Baseline file for the `detect-secrets` to detect secrets][detect-secrets]. In
conjunction with `pre-commit`, `detect-secrets` prevents secrets from being committed
to the repository. The baseline file flags secret-like data that the user deliberately
wishes to commit the to repository.

### `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

[The Code of Conduct for contributors to this project][code-of-conduct], including
maintainers and `nhsdigital` organisation owners.

### `conftest.py`

- [`isort`](#isort)
- [`pytest`](#pytest)
- [code coverage](#code-coverage)

#### `isort`

#### `pytest`

To run the tests within the `tests` folder using the `pytest` Python package, enter
the following command:

```shell
pytest
```

#### Code coverage

To run code coverage using the `coverage` Python package with `pytest`, enter the
following command:

```shell
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

or using the `make` command:

```shell
make coverage_html
```

A code coverage report in HTML will be produced on the code in the `src` folder. This
HTML report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.

### `README.md`

An overview of the Git repository, including all necessary instructions to run the code.

### `requirements.txt`

A list of Python package requirements for this Git repository, which can be installed
